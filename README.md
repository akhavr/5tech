# Why "us" vs "them"

Freedom vs "do as everyone does because fuck you, that's why".

Cited from [here](https://www.facebook.com/dr.orlovsky/posts/10159478685639041)

I am really concerned (and I see long lasting proofs), that
good times of 1970-2000, are entirely over, globally. 
Everything started with 'fighting' terrorism after 2001 and airflights
restrictions, then crisis of 2008 and dismissing the money printing 
limits, after that the end of bank secrecy came, then prohibition of
moving money between countries, now covid and restrictions in real life +
in parallel with that (you might not see it yet) censorship of social media
and absolute survelliance and wiretapping.

We already are living in a brave new world, and there will not be a
'covid is over and everything is back to normal' event.
Quarantine and panic-inducing info-occasions were not introduced
in order to be lifted later. Yes, some part of the restrictions will
be changed into something softer, but total control will not
disappear, it will simply be disguised a bit and will be accompanied
by more stable info-occasions to prove the control is a neccessity.

Though, they are not bothering much on making things up any more.
It seems that politicians and bureaucrats finally realized the impunity
('and what will people do about it?') and started to simply forbid 
whatever they want, randomly, without being afraid of the consequences -
and even without giving any motivation to their decisions or
making those decisions seem logical due to the 'pandemic'. They forbid
simply because they can, and no one will do anything to them for it.

Along with the personal discomfort (which would go through the roof)
all of this will have one very important dimension: long-lasting and 
progressive falling of living standards, increase of poverty, crime,
killing the enterpreneurship, decrease in innovations and the beginning
of the new Dark Ages (obscurantism is already in place btw).

My initial calculation was that the new Dark Ages will be coming upon us
slowly, within dozens of years, but I underestimated the speed of 
historical processes acceleration. Furthermore, we have already lived 
through a couple of dozens years of it. By the way, the well-known
political corectness, war for ecology, bioethics - all of those 
are parts of this same shit. The Global victory of the global 
bureaucracy/nomenclature; USSR-2 spread all over the world, with socialism,
censorship, walking orders, centrally planned economy, unelected nomenclature 
authorities from the "executive committees", ideology (distorted
tolerance and pseudo-multiculturalism), etc.

In order to not be misunderstood again, I'm not denying terrorist attacks,
the fact of existance of the virus (and even some level of its lethality);
I'm not talking about all that. I'm talking about the officials' reaction,
about the way they are using these objective events as the reason for 
inadequate actions, the ones they need so much. They are using those events
by increasing the panic and making up obscurantistic motivations of their 
decisions. And once again, there is no world-level bureaucratic conspiracy,
they are simply using what gets in their hands, and if it were not because of
the virus, they would have used something else, opportunistically, without any
coordination. Just because nomenclature's interests are same all around 
the world, it creates a feeling of existance of some kind of system, though
in reality, it's just a decentralized dellusion (thus - so robust). And the 
thing is not only about bureaucrats, politicians, nomenclature: they are
blood from blood of all the rest of the society, these sadists and masochists
are worth each other and are more than happy for each other.

I'm talking about a different thing: we need to be ready and to take 
actions keeping in mind that all this is going to stay here for a long while.
Thus, I'm asking you, those who are not getting it yet, please understand it
and move from acting in accordance with 'it's all the virus's fault' 
paradigm, to the one based on the fact that virus has nothing to do with this
and it's being used as an excuse for what would have been happenning
anyway (maybe a bit later/slower though) - and it will not disappear
even if the virus goes away.

To everyone, from politicians and society, except for a small
bunch of entrepreneurs and artists which have always been sacrifised, 
free movevement within the Schengen zone, absence of visas with EU etc 
have never been beneficial. And all this is difficult to revert as these 
freedoms were based on  international agreements. This is why they needed to 
find a reason to introduce an emergency state thus cancelling everything
de facto without cancelling it de jure. Same goes for many other 
cases, using many different reasons.

People, the crowd of any country, do not want any immigrants to 'take
away their work places', do not want the freedom of trade (because of
being afraid of price dumping and quality increase). All they want is 
to receive money for free and never have a need to work. And of course,
these wishes will come true thanks to the 'elected' politicians,
and if the politicians are restricted from it by constitution, 
international law or agreements - they will find ways to restrict
this constitution, international laws and agreements, and throughout
the history, emergency state has been used for this purpose. But of course,
the crowd, due to its being dumb, does not understand that after 
fulfilling their wishes, their lives will become much worse. Because
the worsening will happen further down the road and people will not
be able to relate it to themselves or politicians - they will blame
immigrants that live nearby, wealthy people, scientists, witches,
foreign agents, jews whoever. It has always been this way.

This is why I'm encouraging to already start preparing for not
having the freedom of movement between countries, for you being forced
by threatening with a criminal liability to wear signs of obedience
(mask, nose bell whatever), in order to detect the 'wild' and socially
dangerous subjects (meaning - unsubmissive to them). And also, to be
prepared for potentially becoming the scapegoats of every possible
problem the world has, because you have more money than others or
you have a wrong nationality - or, as a last resort - simply because you are
'too smart'.

# Technology basis

Why technology access will be used to control your freedom

This "new deal" policy seldomly will be implemented by direct
agression: you're far too dangerous.  Yet.

Instead you'll be limited in your access to common-day goods and
services, unless you will comply and obey with ever increasing
complexity of "new deal" rules and regulations.  "Cancel culture" is
already well-known for last couple years: you're denied financial
(Visa, PayPal) or communication (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) services
just because your opinion differs and you're censored under prentense
of spreading "fake news".

Since March 2020 you already could be denied your grocceries or
hardware store access if you don't obey useless
[2][cite habr "Why everyone should wear masks"] and potentially
harmfull rule to weak mask.

If this tendency will increase (and it might, since there's no or
little backstops), you'll be progressibely denied to the technology
products access just like in the infamous China's "social scoring
system".

Thus, to maintain and increase your quality of life, you'd better be
able to create them yourself or acquire them in the ways, that aren't
controlled by government.

Roughly speaking [4], you'd better be able to reproduce in your garage
several tehcnology stacks:

1. Material processing.  That's everything that we use physically:
   metals, plastics, wood, et cetera.  Now it's garage-reproduceable
   with great variety of DIY kits, tutorials, etc.
2. Food.  While you can grow most of food yourself now, it's now done
   in a non-scaleable way.  We have to seek effective, automated, and
   scaleable ways to grow self-sustainable amounts of food within a
   household.
3. Chemistry.  Most chemical processes are well-known and well-tought,
   but it's much less automated than material processing.
4. Electric and electronics, including power electronics.  Needs
   substantial amounts of R&D since you can't cheaply and reliably
   create a p-n transition in your garage, yet do it in a scaleable
   manner.
5. Microelectronics and processors.  Needs heavy R&D since most of
   today's processes are centered around hi-capacity hi-capital cost
   mass-produced microelectronics.

In the following chapters we will try to give hints how to implement
such practices yourself, or potential areas to do design and research,
if you're interested.

# Material processing

## Motors

Conventional motors require isolated copper wires and magnets

It might be possible to design a motor, using organic conductors

## Conventional P-N transition

No hope

# Medicine

## Diagnostics

TBD

## Drugs

Same as in Chemistry, basically

## Other treatment

TBD

# Education

Only practical education is useful: if you can't realize your
knowledge by your hands, your instruments, and your software - your
"knowledge" is useless.
